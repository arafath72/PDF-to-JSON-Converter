        "What is Cloud Application Development?\nIt is a software solution with components that are stored and executed on the cloud, and\nthese apps can be accessed with an internet-connected device. It helps businesses by\nemploying only the needed resources and also enables faster time to market.\nGoogle docs, Microsoft 365, Gmail, and Zoom are some common examples of cloud-based\napplications.\nAnsible, Chef, Cloudability, Informatica, Kubernetes, Lacework, and Puppet are some of the\nbest cloud computing tools.\nWhat Is Cloud-Based Apps?\nAny cloud app consists of data and processing logic (code). The last one is quite resource-\nconsuming and needs ample space to be run. Here we have two ways to go: storing the data\non a physical server or load it all to the digital cloud. And now let us speculate a little.\nOf course, we can buy a physical server and store all the data there. But looking into the\nperspective, will we be able to handle 10000 users\u2019 requests and scale data to different\nservices? Well, that might be too tough a challenge. So, if you are planning on a scalable\nbusiness, a cloud provider might be a better option.\nHow Does a Cloud-Based App Work?\nWhile the user interacts with an app via their web browser or mobile, the data processing is\nhandled by remote servers that have enough power to do it. In the case of cloud-based apps,\nthese servers are cloud storages.\nThus, a user\u2019s phone or PC serves only as the \u201cfacade\u201d or input device, while the burden of\nprocessing lies on the cloud. A digital storage significantly offloads the devices\u2019 processor and\nhelps the app run fast.\nCloud-based development is especially relevant for apps that provide real-time interaction\nbetween users. For example, users need to share their live location and communicate in real-\ntime in on-demand delivery and movement apps. Cloud solution is one of the best solutions\nto allow for such real-time processing.\nBenefits Of Developing Cloud-Based Apps\nYou might have already thought about cloud-based storage's perks to the apps\u2019 users. All the\nbenefits come in comparison with hardware servers. So let\u2019s look at them together!\nSmart Spending\nWhen you start using a conventional hardware server, you have to pay for onsite hardware\nand capital expenses. It can cost a pretty penny, especially if your business scales fast. Unlike",
        "hardware servers, cloud servers can be added as needed. Such solutions are applicable on\ndemand, pay as you need.\nScalable Solution\nUsing cloud services allows you to scale up your product any time you want. All you need to\ndo is buy additional space in the cloud and call it a day. In the case of hardware services, this\nis hardly possible. You need to pay for the extra server setup for each user individually, which\ncan take loads of time and effort.\nOpportunity For User Research\nCloud storage is not only a great place for data processing. It helps to gather knowledge about\nwhat features are useful for the user and what are not. With cloud storage, you have access\nto information about the user's experience with the app. This gives you an excellent\nopportunity to track the app's deficiencies and improve the product with the next version.\nSupport On the Provider\nWhile using cloud storage, you do not have to worry about supporting the server\u2019s\ninfrastructure. Bugs, errors, back sets and other server stuff \u2013 all these are handled by the\ncloud provider. You can focus on the maintenance of the product.\nHow To Develop a Cloud-Based App In 6 Steps?\nTalking about the process of cloud-based app development, I would highlight 6 steps.\nStep 1. Market Research\nThe first step you do in any process is exploring the status quo. By that I mean figuring out\nwhat\u2019s going on in the market and niche you are about to step in. Here is what can be done\nat this stage:\n1. Explore the trends: what\u2019s going on globally?\n2. Look at your competitors: how can you be different from them?\n3. What about your users: who are they? What\u2019s their problem?\n4. Finally, what\u2019s your value? How can you solve the problem for your users?\nThe answer to the final question will be your hypothesis, which you will have to validate.\nStep 2. Finding Your Team of Developers\nObviously, you cannot work the whole way up all by yourself. You need a team of developers\nwho will help you at least with the technical aspects of your project. Moreover, things get\neven more complicated when it comes to startup development. Not only do you need a team\nof polished programmers, but also experts in product development. There should be a team\nof people who will find your product's positioning and its technical implementation.",
        "The team for cloud-based app development should match these requirements:\n1. Focused on the product, not only programming;\n2. Be familiar with cloud providers and know the difference between them;\n3. Be flexible and forward-thinking to plan the app\u2019s architecture well.\nHere Is What You Can Do in Your Pursuit of The Perfect Team:\n1. Review ratings and reviews on Clutch, Wadline, GoodFirm, VenturePact;\n2. Check freelancing websites, like Upwork, Toptal, Guru;\n3. Look for company\u2019s websites, blogs, and articles, like this one;\n4. Check companies\u2019 backgrounds and cases.\nStep 3. Make A List of Product Requirements\nNow it is time to list down the features of your cloud-based app that would form your MVP.\nHowever, you cannot get these requirements out of nowhere. The features of your app\nshould derive from the product scope that you and your product managers will make before\nthe project starts. Read more about how to define requirements for your product in our\narticle Functional Vs. Non-Functional Requirements: Why Are Both Important?\nOnce you have the requirements, you know which specific need your product should cover.\nNow make a list of product features that will match this need or needs. These should be basic\nfeatures that most concisely reflect the idea of your product and take the least time for\ndevelopment.\nStep 4. Tech Research & Choosing the Provider\nOne of the most important steps in developing cloud-based applications is choosing the cloud\nprovider. Several popular cloud providers on the market vary in price, services, the territory\nof service:\n1. Amazon Web Service (AWS);\n2. Google Cloud Provider (GCP);\n3. Azure\nMany popular cloud services provide ready-to-go solutions, which can become a part of your\napp. For example, this is authorization in AWS. At the same time, cloud providers try to keep\nup with global tech trends, like Big Data, IoT, or machine learning.\nSo how to choose the right provider for your product? I would suggest looking at such\ncriteria:\n1. Security: does the provider deliver the necessary level of data protection?\n2. Scalability: does the provider allow you to scale up your services?\n3. Price: is the storage affordable enough for you to use it?\n4. Data-processing speed: doesn\u2019t it slow down your app?",
        "Step 5. Launch MVP And Run Tests\nNow it is time to get down to the development stage. Your development team will work on\nthe technical implementation of the first version of your product. With this basic version, you\nwill be able to test your idea with users and see if:\n1. Users like your idea;\n2. Users are ready to use your implementation of this idea.\nGather users\u2019 feedback, improve your product in the following iteration and launch again!\nStep 6. Iterate And Maintain Your App\nAfter the app\u2019s launch, you should check how it works, fix bugs, and make updates.\nSometimes you will need to create custom updates for particular users or companies. You can\nalso add new features, scale the app, enter new markets, etc.\nBefore Building a Cloud-Based App, Consider These\nCloud-based app development is a specific area of development that requires the whole\nteam's unique approach. Here are some moments that should be considered before plunging\ninto the development of cloud-based apps.\nData Security\nThe issue of security is striking when working with databases. For cloud-based applications,\nthis issue is especially acute. For example, it is common for government-related apps not to\nbe allowed to feature a cloud platform because of security concerns.\nLuckily, there are numerous robust measures that you can take to ensure security for your\ncloud storage. Here are some of them:\n1. Using a private cloud. You can create a cloud, which will only include your services,\nthat will be available only to your users. Any exit outwards will only be accessible via\ngateways;\n2. Defining access rules. You can limit the access of people to specific services. For\nexample, people with a premium subscription have access to the service;\n3. Firewalls. These are the \u201cbarriers\u201d that you put between your internal network and\nthe traffic from external sources. Usually, such barriers work according to the rules that\nyou initially set;\n4. Alarm system. Due notification is essential in case some unsanctioned action has\nalready taken place. In such a case, every minute matters. The faster you get this\nnotice, the more minor financial injury you will bear.\nArchitecture Arrangement\nWhen it comes to cloud-based apps, the issue of app architecture comes to the top. In\nparticular, the app architecture should have information on classifying the data for a cloud",
        "provider. Building an architecture means arranging communication between the services and\ndata and organizing these services into full-fledged apps.\nCashing Data\nDoes all the data live in the cloud? Well, not particularly. Sometimes, the app\u2019s data can be\npartially stored on the device itself while \u201ccashed\u201d via its processor. Thanks to this data, the\napp can partially run offline. But once the user gets online again, the app will immediately\nmove the data collected offline to the cloud.\nThink of Scalability\nScalability is also an important thing to consider while developing a cloud-based app. You\nshould always forecast the moment when the traffic on your product increases. If you cannot\nscale at this point, the app won\u2019t handle such traffic surges, and you will lose potential\ncustomers.\nIf you want to build an app, you will most likely develop a cloud-based one. Though\nchallenging in terms of security, architecture, and scalability, this process still gives you more\nopportunities. Cloud solutions focus on business processes while leaving all the maintenance\nissues to the provider. Moreover, using a cloud is cheaper and faster.\nEvery computer or process in a network can act as a server or client in a client-server\narchitecture. Powerful computers, known as client servers, are used just to manage\nnetwork traffic, disk drives, and printers. Clients use their workstations or personal\ncomputers to run their apps. The servers' main function is to supply resources like\nequipment, files, and processing power. In this article, you will learn about what is client\nserver architecture and other aspects of it.\nBut let's first examine the nature of the client and server before learning more about\nimproved client-server architecture.\n\uf0b7 Client: Any computer that makes a request to the server is a client. For instance, when\nwe visit a website, we ask for the page from its domain. So, in this case, we play the\nclient.\n\uf0b7 Server: On the other hand, the server is the computer created to fulfill client requests.\nIn the same scenario as earlier, the client queries the server for the web page, which\nis subsequently returned to them by the server.\nWhat is Client Server Architecture?\nA computing model known as client/server architecture places several components into\nclearly defined roles that allow them to communicate. The majority of the resources and\nservices for client consumption are hosted, delivered, and managed by the server. In a\nshared resources architecture, a central server is connected to one or more client\ncomputers via a network or the internet.",
        "Client/server architecture is also known as a networking computer model or client/server\nnetwork since all requests and services are supplied through a network. Due to the fact\nthat each component is working on its own, it is regarded as a type of distributed cloud\ncomputing system.\nWhat is a client in client server architecture? In a client-server architecture, there are many\nclients (remote processors) who request and receive service from a centralized server (host\ncomputer). Here is a working example of client/server connections. The user or client\nenters the URL while using a browser to typically view a server-side website. The DNS\nserver searches for the IP address of the web server and provides it to the browser. The\nserver, acting as the producer, sends the files in response to an HTTP or HTTPS request\nmade by the browser. As the consumer, the client receives them and often sends follow-\nup inquiries.\nComponents of Client Server Architecture\nA few components are necessary for each architecture to function. The client-server\narchitecture is also built on the three interrelated components that are stated below.\n1. Workstations or Client\nTheir operating systems do not have administration or security policies, centralized\ndatabases, or shared software. They have localized variations of programs and regulations\nthat can be used to apply them independently. Because they are not required to handle\nrequests from numerous computers or store data from many computers, workstations also\nhave fewer technological requirements than servers in the areas of memory, hard drive\nspace, and CPU performance.\n2. Servers\nA server serves as a central repository for network files, programs, databases, and\nregulations, independent of the role it plays. It simplifies maintenance and backup because\nit is not dependent on individual user setups but can be universally and uniformly deployed\nacross the network.\n3. Networking devices\nEach networking device in the client-server architecture operates and has its own set of\nattributes.\n\uf0b7 Hubs are used to connect to a server with different workstations.\n\uf0b7 Repeaters are used to transmit data from one device to another.\n\uf0b7 Bridges are employed for segmenting isolated networks.",
        "What's the Purpose and How Does it Work?\nThe purpose of a client server architecture is to speed up data transmission while also\nprotecting the data sent. It is a smart solution for businesses seeking faster and more\nsecure data transfer.\nHow does it work and interacts with servers?\nIn the client-server architecture, when a client computer sends a data request to the server\nvia the internet, the server accepts the request and returns the data packets requested to\nthe client. The architecture interacts with the servers through the following steps.\n\uf0b7 After the user enters the URL of the website or file, the Browser sends requests to the\nDNS (DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM) Server.\n\uf0b7 The DNS Server searches for the WEB Server's address.\n\uf0b7 The DNS Server then replies with the WEB Server's IP address.\n\uf0b7 The Browser sends an HTTP/HTTPS request to the WEB Server's IP address (provided\nby the DNS server).\n\uf0b7 The Server sends the necessary files for the website.\n\uf0b7 The Browser then renders the files and displays the website. The rendering is\naccomplished with the assistance of a DOM (Document Object Model) interpreter, CSS\ninterpreter, and JS Engine, which is collectively referred to as JIT or (Just in Time)\nCompilers.\nClient-Server Model\nWe now know that client-server architecture consists of two components: one that offers\nservices and the other that uses those services.\nLearn how the browser communicates with the server to gain a greater understanding of\nthe procedure.\n\uf0b7 After the user types the unified resource location (URL) of the website or file, the\nbrowser sends a request to the domain name system (DNS) server.\n\uf0b7 The DNS server responds with the IP address of the web server when asked for the\naddress of the server.\n\uf0b7 Following receiving a response from the DNS server, the browser sends an HTTP or\nHTTPS request to the IP address of the web server, which was provided by the DNS\nserver.\n\uf0b7 The server then sends the essential files for the website.\n\uf0b7 After rendering the files, the browser shows the webpage.\nTypes of Client Server Architecture\nThe following are the different types of client server architecture:\n1-tier architecture",
        "In a 1-tier design, every user interface environment, client/server installation setting, data\nlogic system, and marketing logic system are present on the same system. These services\nare trustworthy, but handling the jobs they assign for replication of the full operation is\nhighly challenging because they contain all the data in multiple variances.\nFor example, one software package can be used for presentation, business, and data access\nlayers. The local machine stores all of the data. There are certain programs that control all\nthree tiers, such as the MP3 player and Microsoft Office, but these programs are\ncategorized as 1-tier apps.\n2-tier architecture\nThe optimum client/server environment is provided by a two-tier design, which enables\nthe user interface to be stored on the client system and all databases to be saved on the\nserver computer. It is necessary to preserve database logic and business logic regardless of\nwhether they are kept on the server or the user's end. The architecture is known as \"fat\nclient thin server\" when these logics are stored on the client side, but we refer to it as \"thin\nclient fat server\" when these logics are handled by the server.\nThe quickest rate is reached because client-server devices are in direct communication\nwith one another when the client fires the order. This strategy has a few advantages, such\nas the best performance, simplicity in 2-tier application design, user satisfaction with the\nresponse from this architecture, and a homogeneous environment.\n3-tier architecture\nMiddleware is required in this three-tiered design because if the client machine makes the\nrequest to the server machine, the middle layer will first receive it before passing it on to\nthe server. Therefore, the middle layer first receives the server's response before passing\nit on to the client machine. Both business and data logic is kept on the middleware.\nMiddleware is used to increase flexibility and provide top performance.\nA three-tier architecture is separated into three layers: the presentation layer (Client\nTier), the application layer (Business Tier), and the database layer (Data Tier). Presentation\nlayer management is handled by the client machine, Application layer management is\nhandled by the server machine, and Database layer management is handled by the\ndatabase layer.\nN-tier architecture\nThe approach is a scaled version with three levels. The strategy is often referred to as\n\"Multi-tier architecture.\" Each function, including display, application processing, and data\nmanagement functionalities, can be placed in this design as a separate layer.",
        "Characteristics of Client-server Architecture\nThe following are the characteristics of client-server architecture:\n\uf0b7 A mechanism of requests and responses powers the architecture. The client sends a\nrequest to the server, and the server returns data in response to the information\nrequested.\n\uf0b7 The architecture uses a common contact protocol so that devices can simply\ncommunicate with one another. Every data transport protocol is available at the\napplication layer.\n\uf0b7 A server may only be able to handle a limited number of client requests at once. It uses\na method targeting priority to respond to each and every query.\n\uf0b7 By assaulting the server with duplicate requests, denial of service attacks makes it\ndifficult for it to respond to legitimate client requests.\n\uf0b7 Scalability is a crucial feature of client-server systems. They can be resized either\nhorizontally or vertically. Adding or removing client workstations while barely affecting\nperformance is known as horizontal scaling. Vertical scaling refers to upgrading to a\nmore powerful server.\n\uf0b7 The environment is frequently multivendor and heterogeneous. Client and server\noperating systems and hardware platforms typically differ from one another. A well-\ndefined set of common application program interfaces (APIs) and remote procedure\ncalls (RPCs) is used by client and server processes to communicate with one another.\nDifference Between System Architecture and Server Architecture\nSystem architecture is a conceptual model that specifies the structure and behaviour of a\nsystem, which is the primary distinction between system architecture and software\narchitecture. Server architecture, in contrast, is a high-level structure that specifies the\nresponses to meet technical and business goals while maximizing the software's quality.\nSystem architecture incorporates both software and hardware parts and is utilized to\nenable the designing of such a composite system. Server architecture, on the other hand,\nconsiders a variety of aspects, including human dynamics, business strategy, quality\naspects, design, and IT architecture, among others.\nAdvantages and Disadvantages of Client-Server Architecture\nAdvantages\n\uf0b7 The server contains all of the necessary data. As a result, it is simple to secure the data\nand offer authentication and authorization.\n\uf0b7 It is not necessary for the server to be close to the clients. The information can still be\naccessed effectively.\n\uf0b7 Customers have limited significance in this architecture and require less management\non a level administration server.\n\uf0b7 It offers service integration, which allows all of your clients to access corporate data\nusing their terminals and removes all pointless log-in rights.",
        "\uf0b7 Data recovery is simpler with a client-server model than it is with decentralized server\nmodels.\nDisadvantages\n\uf0b7 The server could get overwhelmed if every client makes a data request at once. This\ncould cause network congestion.\n\uf0b7 None of the client's requests can be satisfied if the server malfunctions for any reason.\nThis causes the client-server network to fail.\n\uf0b7 Setting up and maintaining a system is expensive.\n\uf0b7 Need a well-qualified staff to maintain the server.\nWhat is a Distributed Cloud?\nA distributed cloud is an architecture where multiple clouds are used to meet compliance\nneeds, performance requirements, or support edge computing while being centrally managed\nfrom the public cloud provider.\nIn essence, a distributed cloud service is a public cloud that runs in multiple locations,\nincluding\n\uf0b7 The public cloud provider\u2019s infrastructure\n\uf0b7 On-premises at end customer locations in the data center or at the edge\n\uf0b7 In another cloud provider\u2019s data center\n\uf0b7 On third party or colocation center hardware\nAlthough there are multiple locations and geographies involved, all of the cloud services are\nmanaged as on from a single control plane that handles the differences and inconsistencies\nin such a hybrid, multi-cloud environment.\nThis distribution of services enables an organization to meet very specific requirements for\nresponse time and performance, regulatory or governance compliance mandate, or other\ndemand requiring cloud infrastructure to be located anywhere other than the cloud\nprovider\u2019s typical availability zones.\n\uf0b7 Reduced latency\n\uf0b7 Lowered or eliminated network congestion\n\uf0b7 Guaranteed quality of service (QoS) for mission critical application and mobile users",
        "What are the benefits of distributed cloud?\nThere are many benefits of a distributed cloud architecture. Gartner points to these as\nnoteworthy:\n\uf0b7 Increased compliance. Distributed by nature, workloads, and data can be located\nwhere they must be to meet regulatory demands.\n\uf0b7 Increased uptime. Since cloud services can reside on local subnets, they can be\nisolated \u2013 even untethered from the main cloud \u2013 when needed to ensure they\nare isolated from a crashed system to provide redundancy.\n\uf0b7 Scalability: Adding VMs or nodes as needed enables not only rapid scalability but\nalso improves the overall availability of the cloud system as a whole.\n\uf0b7 Flexibility: Distributed clouds simplify the installation, deployment, and\ndebugging of new services.\n\uf0b7 Faster processing. Distributed systems can be faster by leveraging compute of\nmultiple systems for a given task. Also, the distributed cloud enables more\nresponsive communications for specific regions.\n\uf0b7 Performance. Unlike centralized computer network clusters, the distributed cloud\ncan provide higher performance and better cost performance.\nHow does a distributed cloud work?\nIn a distributed cloud, services are located or \u2018distributed\u2019 to specific locations to reduce\nlatency and these services enjoy a single, consistent control place across public and private\ncloud environments. Gartner states that organizations can see major performance gains by\nlowering latency and reducing the can deliver major improvements in performance due to\nthe elimination of latency issues, reducing overall risk of outage or control plane\ninefficiencies.\nA distributed cloud takes not just an application but the entire computing stack and\ndistributes it to the locations where it is needed, whether public cloud provider, on-premises,\nor in third party colocation facility. The consuming cloud customer sees this distributed\ninfrastructure as a single cloud entity, and the cloud provider manages all of the elements of\nthe distributed cloud as a whole from a single control plane.\nThe public cloud provider continues to be responsible for all cloud operations, including\nsecurity, availability, updates, and governance of the entire distributed infrastructure. To\nparaphrase Gartner, distributed cloud fixes what hybrid cloud and multi-cloud breaks.\nWhat are use cases for distributed clouds?\nDistributed clouds offer a broad range of applications, from smart edge computing to\nsimplifying the management of multi-cloud environments and hybrid deployments. Common\nuse cases include:\nDistributed cloud and edge computing support everything from simplified multi-cloud\nmanagement to improved scalability and development velocity to the deployment of state-\nof-the-art automation and decision support applications and functionality.",
        "\uf0b7 Edge/IoT. With new uses for video inference and facial recognition being\ndeveloped daily, IoT is using AI and machine learning (ML) for improving\nautomobile manufacture, analyzing medical imaging, to smart buildings and\nsmart cities that find the shortest route to parking and turn off the heating after\nthe last employee has left for the evening. Many of these applications would be\nstymied if data had to traverse from the edge back to the cloud or a data center\nfor analysis and processing.\n\uf0b7 Content optimization. Distributed clouds can effectively become a content\ndelivery network (CDN), which can improve the streaming experience or reduce\nweb page load time latency, offering the best possible user experience for a broad\nrange of applications.\n\uf0b7 Scaling on demand. Distributed clouds enable expansion to existing locations\nwithout the need to build out additional infrastructure. As needs grow, the cloud\nfootprint can grow along seamlessly, supporting the organization\u2019s changing\nneeds.\n\uf0b7 Single pane of glass management. Adopting a distributed cloud approach\nenhances visibility into a hybrid, multi-cloud deployment, including the ability to\nmanage all the infrastructure as a single cloud from a single console with a single\nset of tools.\n\uf0b7 Meet compliance mandates. Local, federal, and international data privacy\nregulations can mandate where a user\u2019s personal information must be stored and\nwhether that information can travel outside that jurisdiction. In those cases\nwhere the data can\u2019t be moved to the public cloud provider, the public cloud\nprovider can effectively be moved to the data, ensuring not only that governance\nand regulatory mandates are met but that data will be processed as efficiently\nand with the minimum amount of latency.\nWhat is the difference between cloud and distributed cloud?\n\uf0b7 Traditional Cloud Computing is the delivery of IT resources and services on\ndemand, including servers, storage, and databases, to name a few. These services\nare typically provided over the public internet or private network connection from\none of many hyperscale cloud providers. Cloud services can be categorized as\npublic cloud, private cloud (including on-premises data centers), hybrid cloud (the\ncombination of public and private), and multi-cloud (including multiple public\ncloud providers).\n\uf0b7 Distributed Cloud Computing discards the categories of public, private, hybrid,\nand multi-cloud. The distributed cloud presents to the user organization as a\nsingle cloud platform, but in reality, it is comprised of multiple components that\ncan include \u2018all of the above \u2013 public cloud elements from the primary provider\nand one or more of its competitors, private cloud or enterprise data center, and\nthird-party colocation partner. These varied elements are all managed as one by\nthe primary cloud provider and consumed as one by the ultimate customer.",
        "What are the challenges of distributed cloud?\nManaging an enterprise using a multi-site cloud deployment has its challenges, including:\n\uf0b7 Bandwidth. A broadly dispersed multi-cloud environment may have different\nconnectivity models for each location. Moving more computing to the edge can\nstress existing broadband connections and require upgrading or adapting to meet\nincreased demand for throughput.\n\uf0b7 Security. Securing a distributed cloud presents new challenges for both cloud\nproviders and end users, as resources can be scattered across the globe and can\nbe collocated with other enterprise servers and storage resources.\n\uf0b7 Data protection. Backup and business continuity plans for dispersed data\nresources may require a redesign of backup and recovery strategies to ensure data\nstays in the geographies it is supposed to.\nCloud Application\nWhat are Cloud Native Applications and Traditional Applications?\nAn application created specifically for a cloud computing architecture is called cloud-native.\nThese applications are built to take advantage of the inherent benefits of a cloud computing\nsoftware delivery model. They are hosted and run in the cloud. A native app is a software\ncreated specifically for a platform or gadget.\nTraditional application development is an older method of creating apps now referred to as\nlegacy applications. They operate in a client-server or mainframe environment and have a\nmonolithic architecture.\nTraditional vs. Cloud Native Applications\nTraditional Applications are the ones that were created 10 to 20 years ago. These basic\napplications run on a mainframe environment or do have a client/server environment. Most\npeople in information technology(IT) usually refer to these applications only as \"really old\" or\nancient.\" They are old workhorses that have yet to be retired. Expanding the Application\nbased on these technologies usually brings a lot of hassle. Plenty of new hardware has to be\npurchased to upgrade or scale up to the next level in data storage and support services.\nCloud Computing is a term that has become quite popular in recent times, regardless of the\nfact if you are working in IT or not. We are moving away from the world of inactive, flat, and\nsluggish worlds of traditional Applications to a world that is faster, more active, and versatile\nin its approach. The concept of Cloud Native Applications started making its impression in the\nlast ten years or so. Still, it brought the necessary change in the process and the ideas, which\nis why the Traditional vs. Cloud Native Applications comparison came into existence.",
        "Why is Everyone Inclined Toward Cloud Native Applications?\nOrganizations is shifting from Traditional application methodologies to the cloud-native\nmindset. Cloud-native is the name for an approach for building applications and services\nwhich are specific to the cloud environment. It represents the characteristics of the apps and\nservices. The cloud approach helps Businesses to reach their full potential. The Cloud-native\ntrend is growing so fast that it is reshaping the core idea of how companies tackle application\ndevelopment projects. Research indicates that organizations is adopting cloud-native\napplication development techniques, and by the year 2020, almost 32% of new enterprise\napplications will be developed as cloud-native projects.\nTraditional vs. Cloud Native Applications:\n1. Development Time\nTraditional Applications usually take a lot of time to be built, especially when compared to\ntheir Cloud-native counterpart. They are usually developed and released as one big package.\nWhereas, Cloud-native experts conform to a framework that is designed to maximize\nflexibility.\n2. Operating System Dependency\nThe other main comparison is in terms of OS. The traditional Application architecture allows\nfor the dependency between the operating system and the Application. This dependency is\nthe reason which makes migration and scalability an entirely complex and challenging issue.\nWhereas the architecture for the Application based on cloud-native is designed to permit\ndevelopers to use the platforms as a means to abstract away the dependencies. The main\nmotive behind this is to let the teams focus on what matters while comparing Traditional vs.\nCloud Native Applications.\n3. Release Pace\nThe Cloud-native approach also ensures a faster release pace for an update means a company\nresponds to the user need faster, eventually increasing users' retention. This is only possible\nbecause a specific bug can be located or traced to a particular microservice within a specific\ncontainer. Once that bug is fixed hence will be updated quickly. After all, it is not an entirely\nnew version of the Application. It is just some new lines of code. The amount of time spent\nsearching for the problem's source and then working on a fix is significantly less than the\ntraditional approach, which eventually saves time and money.\n4. Transition\nThe other main difference is the way development works in both cases. In traditional\napplications, the developers will provide the finished application code to the operations team,\nand they will run that in production, which slows things down. The Priorities of the\norganizational structure in traditional applications take priority over customer value. In\ncontrast, the cloud native follows a different approach as it combines people, processes, and",
        "tools. It provides a swift and smooth transition toward transferring finished application code\ninto production.\n4. Cost\nCloud-native is cost-effective, and you only pay for what you use, unlike traditional\nApplications where you have to set up the data storage and all the services. This is despite\nthe amount of work being done as the downtime is low, which means the work performance\nis improved. The profit is increased in the longer run.\n5. Security\nThe security of data is a significant concern. The cloud might seem less secure than storing\ndata at local storage as anyone with access to the server can view and use the stored data\nand the Application on the cloud. But it is one of the primary reasons why Cloud-Native\nSecurity is famous as the ability of the data to be accessed from anywhere across the globe\nmakes it easy to use.\nRisks of Traditional App Development\nTraditional App Development is an excellent way to develop applications. However, it\ncomprises some serious risks that might impact your business severely. For example:\n1. Hard-Coding\nWhen an organization works on the automation process, there is always a risk of hard-coding\nsome human errors into its essential infrastructure. Also, incorporating human operators\nslows down the process of diagnosing issues. The use of computer automation nullifies these\nchallenges.\n2. Downtime",
        "This might occur with human error and downtime. In the cloud, there is a fair amount of\nautomation. Updates are deployed automatically without interfering with the deployed\nApplication or the user base. Scalability, testing, as well as resource allocation can be\nautomated. Cloud provides Greater Protection from failures. As all the microservices are\nisolated in containers means if something fails, it is only limited in its scope; the whole\nApplication does not go down, which makes it more reliable.\n3. Low Backup Capabilities\nTraditional applications often offer low backup capabilities; a small mistake can lead to failure.\nIn comparison, backups on the cloud are automated. The containers provide dynamic and\nhigh-quality virtualization on top of the VM-matching microservices. Clusters are placed\nacross the VM to get their benefits in elastic scaling and recovery. The traditional Application\ncan constantly be refactored by changing the code, not changing the site's infrastructure, and\nmoving to the cloud infrastructure.",
        "MVC\nThe Model View Controller Pattern \u2013 MVC Architecture and Frameworks\nWhat is MVC?\nMVC stands for model-view-controller. Here's what each of those components mean:\n\uf0b7 Model: The backend that contains all the data logic\n\uf0b7 View: The frontend or graphical user interface (GUI)\n\uf0b7 Controller: The brains of the application that controls how data is displayed\nToday the MVC pattern is used for modern web applications because it allows the application\nto be scalable, maintainable, and easy to expand.\nWhy Should You Use MVC?\nThe MVC pattern helps you break up the frontend and backend code into separate\ncomponents. This way, it's much easier to manage and make changes to either side without\nthem interfering with each other.\nHow to Use MVC\nTo better illustrate the MVC pattern, A web application that shows how these concepts all\nwork.\nMy Car Clicker application\nHere are some of the major differences in my app:\n1. Multiple car models are listed\n2. There are multiple click counters\n3. It only displays the selected car",
        "Now let's dive into these three components that make up the MVC architecture pattern.\nModel (data)\nThe model's job is to simply manage the data. Whether the data is from a database, API, or a\nJSON object, the model is responsible for managing it.\nIn the Car Clicker application, the model object contains an array of car objects with all the\ninformation (data) needed for the app.\nViews (UI)\nThe view's job is to decide what the user will see on their screen, and how.\nThe Car Clicker app has two views: carListView and CarView.\nBoth views have two critical functions that define what each view wants to initialize and\nrender.\nController (Brain)\nThe controller's responsibility is to pull, modify, and provide data to the user. Essentially, the\ncontroller is the link between the view and model.\nThrough getter and setter functions, the controller pulls data from the model and initializes\nthe views.\nIf there are any updates from the views, it modifies the data with a setter function.\nMVC Frameworks\nJavaScript has grown in popularity, and it's taken over the backend in recent years. More and\nmore full-blown JavaScript applications have opted for the MVC architecture pattern in one\nway or another.\nFrameworks come and go, but what has been constant are the concepts borrowed from the\nMVC architecture pattern.\nSome of the early frameworks that applied these concepts were KnockoutJS, Django,\nand Ruby on Rails.\nModern web applications are very complex, and making a change can sometimes be a big\nheadache.\nManaging the frontend and backend in smaller, separate components allows for the\napplication to be scalable, maintainable, and easy to expand."
